## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

This project expanded my knowledge of box shadows, spacing flex elements, and how to build a hover overlay for an image.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to focus on using rem or em instead of px for sizing and spacing.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp) - This page helped me understand the box-shadow stynax.
